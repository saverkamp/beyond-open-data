This study is a general attempt at finding data to build a small thing on top of. I took the lazy way out and came across the Philadelphia Museum of Art's ["hackathon"](https://hackathon.philamuseum.org/) page, which has been set up as a public-facing, experimental API. I appreciated the upfront-ness about this page, where it explicitly states that this is an experiment and that they are still in the early stages of infrastructure-building. "We're sharing our work-in-progress version of what could possibly become our collection data access layer with you." This is nice.

The API framework comes with an explorer tool so I can test out API calls right in my browser without having to set things up and deal with raw JSON data, reducing clumsiness and letting me get what I want more quickly, which is an understanding of what kind of data I can see and how I can grab it.

## For me: http://localhost:8000  
## For you: http://bits.ashleyblewer.com/smash-art/

So to celebrate how nice this open access to data was, with a quick and easy-to-use API, and how much I appreciate the Philadelphia Museum of Art for making this stuff available to me, a developer, I made a game about smashing up all the art in the museum. 

The premise of the game is simple (some could say... contrived). You are an Eagle avatar and the goal of the game is to smash up all the art in the museum because you are *extremely* excited about the Superbowl.
