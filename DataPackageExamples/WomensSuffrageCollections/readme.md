# Women's Suffrage Collections at NYPL and Library of Congress

This dataset was created for the sole purpose of illustrating how to explore and manipulate tabular data and to give an example of Frictionless Data data packages at a [talk and workshop](https://github.com/saverkamp/loc-talk-2017) at the Library of Congress on November 13, 2017. It contains descriptive metadata for digitized objects from two collections: The Schwimmer-Lloyd collection (Series V: Schwimmer-Lloyd photographs) from the New York Public Library Manuscripts and Archives Division and the National American Woman Suffrage Association Collection from the Library of Congress Rare Book Division.  

The data was created by harvesting the MODS XML records through each collection's API and crosswalking selected elements to a tabular format using [Python scripts](https://github.com/saverkamp/loc-talk-2017/tree/master/womens-suffrage-collections-data/scripts)
