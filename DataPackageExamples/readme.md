# Data Package Examples
The [Frictionless Data project](https://frictionlessdata.io) includes [specifications](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/) for creating data packages--container formats for sharing and documenting datasets. Data packages include resources, such as data files and supplementary materials, and metadata that describes the structure and content of the package. Metadata is recorded in a `datapackage.json` file in the top-level directory of the package. This file should use basic metadata properties outlined in the Frictionless Data [Data Package spec](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/data-package/) but can also include any additional properties relevant to your domain or content. A helpful data package should also include a data dictionary to aid in interpretation of your data.  

We've included a few examples of `datapackage.json` files (without their datasets--most are too large to include in this repo) to show you how you might describe cultural heritage and library data. (You'll notice in the `path` properties that these packages point to external sources for data files. Ideally, you'll want to include your `datapackage.json` file in a package with your data files, so you should reference their paths relative to this manifest.)  

For a more human-friendly view of these files, you can use the [OKFN's Data Package Viewer](http://data.okfn.org/tools/view). Just paste in the link to the raw version of the `json` file.
